The project ran for 4 months from August to November 2019 and involved 12+ experts from all divisions. My role was a graphic designer/art director exploring a diverse range of design areas such as packaging design and editorial design. The brief was to create a company portfolio based on the requirements of four different submissions, each submission requires a book, USB, entry form and presentation box.",

The artistic impression of New Zealand map is printed on a gold foil across the lid to represent the idea of opening up a world-class property opportunity in New Zealand. This is also presented with a short phrase ‘Opening the doors to New Zealand’ along with the company logo. The few considerations I had was a) to find the right material that can hold up to 20kg (Total weight expected), b) to place the New Zealand motif into the right position that can run over two surfaces only due to the tight budget and c) to come up with an appropriate solution to keep the lid closed tight but smooth enough to open."},

Each box contains one book, one USB and hard copy supporting materials. The biggest challenge we had every year was to fit a lot of hard copy materials into this box which is highly restricted in size (dimension) and weight (5kg). I tried to keep the inner tray as thin as possible to secure more space for the hard copies but to accommodate a decent height of book, 10mm was the best option. I’ve added a ribbon pull tag on the tray for easier access to the book and hard copies underneath."},
            {"Path":"/images/IPA/IPA3.jpg", "imageText": "I have created four books with approximately 60-90 pages each. The book was in a square format for the past 3 years but I have changed it to portrait layout to cut down some page numbers. Because of the box size restrictions and amount of documents and contents to fit in, the book had to be thinner. By doing this I was able to cut down 10 to 20 pages each book. This also allowed me to include more visual references. The contents were supplied by our communications team, photography was produced by our external photographer under my direction."},
